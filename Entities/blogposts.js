Cloud migrations succeed when strategy, governance, and automation move together. At EasOps we start with discovery workshops to map critical workloads, compliance constraints, and business timelines.

## Build a Shared Migration Map
- Document business drivers and success metrics.
- Catalogue dependencies, data gravity, and compliance zones.
- Prioritise quick wins to validate the strategy early.

## Harden Landing Zones
We establish automated landing zones using Terraform and policy-as-code. Network segmentation, identity federation, and cost guardrails are defined as code from day one.

## Iterate with Proofs of Concept
Run proofs of concept to validate security controls, observability, and automation pipelines. Each iteration feeds back into the migration roadmap and change management plan.

## Operationalise and Optimise
Use observability and FinOps practices to measure availability, spend, and experience. Continuous optimisation keeps the migrated platform resilient and efficient.

Modern migrations are a journey—our teams stay engaged through enablement and documentation so your operators can sustain the momentum.`

AI agents are transforming how teams coordinate work. EasOps blends process mining, LangChain orchestration, and human-in-the-loop design to deliver measurable automation.

## Map the Work as It Happens
Shadow critical roles and analyse telemetry to find friction points. The real value emerges when you digitise tribal knowledge and exceptions.

## Compose Automation with Guardrails
We combine API integrations, retrieval-augmented generation, and event-driven triggers to orchestrate complex processes. Guardrails—like approval steps and drift monitoring—keep the system trustworthy.

## Empower People with Insights
Automation is not just about removing humans. Dashboards, copilots, and guided actions help teams focus on creativity and decisions that matter.

The future belongs to organisations that align automation with culture, policy, and continuous learning.`

Dashboards alone are not enough. Operators need decision-ready data that blends metrics, playbooks, and collaboration.

## Start with Jobs-to-be-Done
Interview operators to understand what decisions they make, what data they trust, and where delays occur.

## Build Semantic Layers
Invest in models that translate raw data into consistent business language. This unlocks self-serve exploration and analytics apps.

## Close the Loop
Integrate alerts and recommended actions directly into the tools teams already use. Feedback loops ensure the data product evolves with the operation.

When data products deliver context and actionability, teams run smoother and customers feel the difference.`

    content: `# Governance Frameworks for Generative AI

Generative AI introduces new opportunities and new risks. EasOps helps teams design governance models that keep innovation aligned with policy.

## Define Policy Boundaries
Work with legal, compliance, and product leaders to outline acceptable use, data retention, and model lifecycles.

## Operational Controls
Implement observability for prompts, outputs, and user feedback. Monitor drift, bias, and security exposure continuously.

## Enable Responsible Experimentation
Provide sandboxes with automated guardrails so product squads can learn quickly without exposing sensitive data.

A strong governance framework enables scale—teams innovate faster when they know the rules of the road.`
